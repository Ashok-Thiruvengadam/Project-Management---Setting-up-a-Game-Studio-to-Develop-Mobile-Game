# Project-Management---Setting-up-a-Game-Studio-to-Develop-Mobile-Game

Implemented a project of setting up a game studio to develob mobile game and generate revenue out of it by implementing project management principles.

I have defined the project obectives and by taking into account all the critical success factors and assumptions.

Further designed an project organization for defining clear responsiblites of team, which team is responsible for what and to effectively utilize workforce.

Created an implementation plan using: Work Breakdown Structure, Scheduling, GANTT Chart, PERT Analysis and Responsibility chart.

Then performed Risk analysis: 1. Qualitative risk analysis  2. Quantitative risk analysis

Identified all the risk associated with project and highlighted the top 10 possible risks

Implemented a solid Monitoring and control plan 

Montioring plan is implemented in different phases: Initiation phase, Planning phase, Execution phase, Control phase, Closing phase.

And Control plan via Physical asset control, Human resource control, Process control.

Financial plan is made taking into account all the assumptions and resoucre allocation is done effectively by estimating the expenses of salaries working on the
project, cost of setup, and through cost benefit analysis.

Finally a conclusion is submitted to the game development company.

Please refer the attached project proposal.

Top 10 learnings from the Project Management course and implementing the project:

1. I would highly rate the financial planning part. As I didn’t have any previous experience with
finance, accounting, or auditing. I felt learning how to implement a financial plan by making cost
benefit plan, resource allocation and assumptions. I am eager to implement this in my future
work.
2. Earlier I found case study as verbose and boring, and I never aced case studies earlier in my
interviews. Now after solving the Harvard level case study assignments of different sectors of
business by implementing the project management principles, by considering all the facts and
getting the perspective of my teammates and defending the facts that I understood from the case
study, I feel confident in solving case study.
3. Thirdly, I would rate the implementation part. Me coming from a tech background earlier while
devising an implementation plan, I will just list out the things for scheduling. And then while
implementing the project I would feel I missed some steps in mid of implementing the project.
Now after learning scheduling with GANNT chart, PERT analysis I feel even minute details are
scheduled and we get an exact timeline of the project and responsibilities are also well defined
through RACI chart.
4. I would rate what all conflicts we could experience during different stages of a project and how
to manage conflicts efficiently. How cool and synchronized the team maybe, in longer at one
point there might be conflicts. I would love to implement these techniques in future to handle my
team.
5. Uncertainty of authority may cause conflict and if there is no proper structure or hierarchy of
team might also lead to inefficient team. So here comes the importance of defining a proper
project organization to define the roles of the team and defining responsibility of who reports to
whom and who manages the different phases of project.
6. Then I will rate Risk analysis, again I would assess risk in layman point of view or from
perspective of technical person. Now I am confident I will list of risks associated from all
perspectives and I could categorize and determine severity, PRN, rate of occurrence through
qualitative and quantitative risk analysis.
7. I would say working with a diverse team from different backgrounds on working on different
stages of project really helped me gain lot of knowledge and how a teammate from business
degree shares their point of view and collaborating from different time zones also helped gain
full-fledged experience.
8. I would rate auditing as one of my top learning outcomes from this course. I literally didn’t even
have a clue what was the need for it except the financial auditing. Now I understand the types of
audits, how to choose and audit, size of audit team, how it impacts the goals, future projects
quality, customers impact, area of improvement.
9. I would rate negotiation skill. I had very poor negotiation skill earlier, now I feel learning all the
necessary negotiation skills like principled negotiation, awareness, adaptability, and persistence I
feel confident that I will be able to negotiate effectively in future.
